gradle-packer-plugin
====================

This plugin allows to run [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) builds from Gradle.

1.	It parses Packer's templates and creates Gradle tasks to run Packer.
	For each template it creates single task to run all builders at once
	and separate task for each builder.

2.	It could pass used-defined variables to Packer.

3.	It configures tasks' inputs and outputs so that Gradle could detect
	tasks as UP-TO-DATE.

Example of use:
```groovy
plugins {
	id 'org.fidata.packer' version '2.4.0'
}

packer {
	variables = [
		'packer_output_dir': packerOutputDir,
		'aws_access_key': awsAccessKey,
		'aws_secret_key': awsSecretKey
	]
	template 'src/base_images/UbuntuServer16.04.1-amd64.json'
}
```

## Requirements
*	[Packer](https://www.packer.io/)

## Task names
Plugin creates series of tasks for cleaning and running Packer builds.
If template has a `name` variable, it is used instead of template
filename. High-level task names are:

*      `packerClean-<name variable or template filename>`
*      `packerBuild-<name variable or template filename>`
*      `packerClean-<name variable or template filename>-<build name>`
*      `packerBuild-<name variable or template filename>-<build name>`

## Supported Packer configurations:
*	Builders:
	*	`virtualbox-iso` and `virtualbox-ovf`.

		The following fields are considered as inputs:
		*	`source_path` (for `virtualbox-ovf`)
		*	`floppy_files`
		*	preseed file from `http_directory` (only one file is
		supported)
		*	`ssh_key_path`

	*	`amazon-ebs`

		Plugin queries AWS for `source-ami` or `source_ami_filter` and
saves results in Gradle's cache.

		The following fields are also considered as inputs:
		*	`ssh_private_key_file`
		*	`user_data_file`

*	Provisioners:

	`only`, `except` and `override` configurations are supported.

	*	`shell`.

		The following fields are considered as inputs:
		*	`script`
		*	`scripts`
		
	*	`chef-solo`.

		The following fields are considered as inputs:
		*	`config_template`
		*	`cookbook_paths`
		*	`data_bags_path`
		*	`encrypted_data_bag_secret_path`
		*	`environments_path`
		*	`roles_path`

*	Post-processors:

	`only` and `except` configurations are supported.

	*	`vagrant`.

		The following fields are considered as inputs:
		*	`vagrantfile_template`
		*	`include`

		`override` configuration is supported.

*	Functions:

	Now only a subset of Packer template functions is supported:
	*	`build_name`
	*	`build_type`
	*	`pwd`
	*	`template_dir`
	*	`timestamp`
	*	`uuid`

## Gradle Offline Mode

This plugin doesn't respect Gradle's `--offline` command line argument.

1.  Although it is feasible to detect that
    specific builder/provisioner/post-processor doesn't require
    network connection itself, it is not so for provisioning scripts.
    VirtualBox VM created from local ISO could be provisioned
    with scripts that run `apt-get install` inside.
    There is no (simple) way to detect it and prevent running such task
    in offline mode.
    Generally, Packer builds almost always require network connection.

2.  I haven't seen live examples where Gradle's `--offline`
    command line argument is used for something useful
    except testing and debugging purposes. So, I see little benefit
    in its support.

## Notes
1.	Gradle (as of 3.2) [can't handle URLs](
https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:file(java.lang.Object)).

	However, it is usually safe to assume that ISOs in the web
are not changed.

## Security Notes
Plugin uses Jackson to deserialize Packer templates from JSON
to nice Groovy objects.
Although this plugin is secure by itself, it allows other (custom)
plugins to register its own builders, provisioners and post-processors.
This could open a security vulnerability if used carelessly.
See [this whitepaper produced by NCC Group](
https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/jackson-deserialization/)
for examples of exploits.

To mitigate this risk:
*   Use only trusted Gradle plugins
*   Only work with Packer templates come from trusted sources
