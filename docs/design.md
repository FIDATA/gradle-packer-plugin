## Interpolation

Run is made in several stages:
1.  Interpolation of user variables
2.  Interpolation of builder headers
    (there is only one interpolable string, build name)
3.  Interpolation of the whole builder,
    and also provisioners and post-processors
4.  Determining of output artifacts

The first two stages are implemented in `Template.doInterpolate`.
The third stage is implemented in the following methods:
*   `Template.interpolateForBuilder`
*   `Builder.doInterpolate`
*   `Provisioner.interpolateForBuilder`
*   `PostProcessor.interpolateForBuilder`

The forth stage is implemented in the following methods:
*   `Template.interpolateForBuilder`
*   `Builder.run`
*   `PostProcessor.postProcess`

When plugin is applied to `Settings` and tasks are created automatically
then stages 1 and 2 are passed before task creation. // TODO
Stage 3 is passed when Gradle detects task inputs/outputs
before its run.

1. Interpolate variables with env function
2. Strigize provided variable values
3. Remove env function
4. Combine variables with provided values
5. Interpolate builder headers (name)
6. Add name

## Inputs

Not considered as inputs:
*   timing settings
*   passwords
*   connection settings
*   staging/temp paths on images

Considered:
*   paths on images (except staging/temp)
*   users under which provisioning is happening, sudo settings

## Paths

Context gets `cwd` resolved relatively to project dir already,
and after that `Project#file` and `Project#dir` methods
are not necessary.
Other methods (`Project#files` and `Project#fileTree`) get paths
resolved to `cwd`, so that project dir doesn't mess with them.
