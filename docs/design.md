## Interpolation

Run is made in several stages:
1.  Interpolation of user variables
2.  Interpolation of builder headers
    (there is only one interpolable string, build name)
3.  Interpolation of the whole builder,
    and also provisioners and post-processors
4.  Determining of output artifacts

The first two stages are implemented in `Template.doInterpolate`.
The third stage is implemented in the following methods:
*   `Template.interpolateForBuilder`
*   `Builder.doInterpolate`
*   `Provisioner.interpolateForBuilder`
*   `PostProcessor.interpolateForBuilder`

The forth stage is implemented in the following methods:
*   `Template.interpolateForBuilder`
*   `Builder.run`
*   `PostProcessor.postProcess`

When plugin is applied to `Settings` and tasks are created automatically
then stages 1 and 2 are passed before task creation. // TODO
Stage 3 is passed when Gradle detects task inputs/outputs
before its run.

1. Interpolate variables with env function
2. Strigize provided variable values
3. Remove env function
4. Combine variables with provided values
5. Interpolate builder headers (name)
6. Add name

## Inputs

Plugin tries to to its best to determine what affects produced artifacts
and what not.

What plugin is able to do:
*   Parse Packer template, interpolate template functions and
    and hand over to Gradle only these properties that are important
    for the outcome.

    Not considered as inputs:
    *   timing settings
    *   passwords
    *   connection settings
    *   staging/temp paths on images

    Considered:
    *   persistent paths on images
    *   users under which provisioning is happening,
        sudo/elevated settings

What plugin is not able to do:
*   Parse shell scripts to detect whether script will actually
    do something:

    *   [Making provisioner steps conditional on the variable value
        with shell `if` command
        ](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/user-variables.html#making-a-provisioner-step-conditional-on-the-value-of-a-variable)
        is not supported.

        Plugin assumes provisioner is run each time
        regardless of the actual value of the variable.

    *   Testing for `PACKER_BUILDER_TYPE` environment variable
        inside script like [this](
        https://github.com/chef/bento/blob/master/_common/virtualbox.sh)
        is not supported too.

        To limit the run of the script on specific builds
        `only` and `except` configurations should be used.

## Paths

Context gets `cwd` resolved relatively to project dir already,
and after that `Project#file` and `Project#dir` methods
are not necessary.
Other methods (`Project#files` and `Project#fileTree`) get paths
resolved to `cwd`, so that project dir doesn't mess with them.
